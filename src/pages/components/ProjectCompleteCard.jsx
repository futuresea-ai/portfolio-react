          about: "Designed and developed an AI-powered system capable of detecting abnormal heart conditions using audio recordings from a standard stethoscope. The pipeline captured heart sound data via a user-friendly web and mobile interface, preprocessed signals using MATLAB for noise reduction and frequency enhancement, then fed cleaned audio into deep learning models built with TensorFlow/Keras. Achieved 94.27% diagnostic accuracy, reducing false positives by 20% through hybrid model tuning (CNN + SVM + KNN). The end-to-end system was deployed via a Django backend and React frontend, with real-time analysis triggered in the cloud using Databricks and served through secure APIs. Integrated role-based access for clinicians and patients, and supported multi-device accessibility with responsive design.",

The backend was developed in Django, integrating secure patient data management, trial workflows, and investigator dashboards. The frontend, built with React, offered participants and researchers real-time updates, notifications, and multi-device access. Integrated AI models to monitor patient-reported outcomes and detect anomalies in trial data, improving early intervention capabilities by 35%. Used Twilio for telehealth and messaging, and deployed on AWS with S3 for data storage and Lambda for scalable functions.
